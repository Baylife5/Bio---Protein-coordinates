# Bio---Protein-coordinates
program that takes three sets of atomic coordinates, all provided on a single line. The program then calculates the bond lengths and angles.

asks for and collects three sets of coordinates using input(), only use 1 line for this data !!
outputs the N-C and N-Ca bond lengths and the C-N-Ca bond angle with correct number of significant digits (see below)
For example, if I enter the following coordinates (notice.. they are all on one line !!!) : 

C = (39.447, 94.657, 11.824) N = (39.292, 95.716, 11.027) Ca = (39.462, 97.101, 11.465)

then the program will output the following three lines: 

N-C bond length = 1.33
N-Ca bond length = 1.46
C-N-Ca bond angle = 124.0

(Note: make sure that the angle returned is in degrees !!)
